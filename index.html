          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">It looks like poverty is related to the lack of healthcare and smokers' percentage. 
             In both cases, we can say that there is a slightly positive correlation. While the poverty percentage increase also
             the number of smokers and healthcare deficiency.
             <br>  
             The obesity percentage is pretty high in every state of the United States, and it doesn't show any apparent correlation against
             poverty percentage.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">In the chart of median age vs. lack of healthcare, we can see that, in most of the states, the median
            age of the population is between 36 and 40 years old.  And we also can observe that there is a slightly negative correlation
            between these two variables. It means that in states with higher median age, there is less healthcare deficiency.
            <br>
            There is no apparent correlation between the median age of the population and the percentage of smokers or obesity . 
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">Talking about the household income median, we can say that there's no visible correlation with the
            lack of healthcare in the population. But we can see a negative one with the percentage of smokers and obesity. In both cases, 
            we can say that at a higher income, there is less percentage of smokers and obese people.
