# D3-challenge

## Title:
Data Journalism and D3

## Description:
In this project, you will find a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The information to analyze is from the U.S. Census Bureau
and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The visualization available is a dynamic chart where you can choose what health risk do you want to see against any
available demographic.                                                                                                                                            

The data set included with the project is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. 
The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for “margin of error.”
